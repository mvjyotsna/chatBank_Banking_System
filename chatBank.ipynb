    " \n",
    "Description: Here is a simple Banking System coded in Python, that allows users to create Savings and    Checking accounts or eiher one of them. This is an interactive system that asks for inputs from users, processes data, stores the processed data in SQLite tables and logs exceptions into a file.\n",
    "    Having developed end to end projects in Legacy Mainframe based applications, this is my first ever desktop app using modern concepts like Object Oriented programming, and tools like SQLite, DBeaver, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    "Challenges and scope of improvement: Have tried MYSql but have encountered system issues and had to switch to SQLite. In future I want to code using Prostgres or MySQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Setup and run:\n",
    "        1. SQLite database is needed. Create a folder for Banking tables to be created.\n",
    "        2. SQLite database path is the first input that system takes in.\n",
    "        3. Errors and exceptions will be logged into file chatBank.log\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of Banking System: \n",
    "       this is a simple banking system that creates accounts, lets users deposit and withdraw amount. Also maintains Employees data which can be accessed by Bank Managers only and their Employee Ids are 1,2,3,4 or 5.\n",
